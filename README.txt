# CyberSec-Project
This is a project for my High School Cybersecurity course

The goal of this project is to convert my regular caesar cipher into something unique

The way that the cipher works is technically the same way as a caesar cipher, but with some big differences
    The shift is defined by the current date, the month day and year that the message is encrypted is important to be tracked
    The alphabet that is used is randomly scrambled and includes all ASCII characters, so a shift of 1 does not shift a->b, it actually would be a->â”œ

Due to these differences i have opted to give it its own name, originally i named it the Wilson-Anderson Schema, after me and my boyfriend at the time. Now i can only imagine to call it the Wilson Schema
